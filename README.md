- Adapt Mobile First Approach.
- All pages must use heading elements.
- Heading elements must convey the structure of the documents, rather than the editorial emphasis of its content.
- Heading elements must be ordered hierarchically.
- Headings should be followed by further content.
- Headings should not be treated as standalone content.
- Headings must not have a consecutive series of same level headings without content between each.
- Headings may have sequential headings (without content between each) to specify hierarchy.
- There must be one and only one H1 per page.

# HTML

## Section Content Elements
- A Section is essentially a container and is used to separate content based on its meaning.
- Four section elements are categorized as "Sectioning content elements":
  - `<article/>`
  - `<aside/>`
  - `<nav/>`
  - `<section/>`
- These are known as "Sectioning Content" elements because they define the scope of headings (`<h1/>` to `<h6/>` and `<hgroup/>`) and footers (`<footer>`) in a document.
- Sections can be nested within one another in a document.

### Section `<section/>`
- The section element represents a generic section of a document or application. A section, in this context, is a thematic grouping of content, typically within a heading.
- Examples of sections would be chapters, the various tabbed pages in a tabbed dialog box, or the numbered sections of a thesis. A web site's home page could be split into sections for an introduction, content, etc.

### Nav
- The nav element represents a section of the page that links to the pages or to parts within the page.

### Aside
- The aside element represents a section of a page
